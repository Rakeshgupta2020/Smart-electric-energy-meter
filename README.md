As we all know that nowadays electricity has become a limited resource to use, so to measure and monitor energy usage in an efficient way the smart energy meter comes into a role
The purpose of this project is to integrate the Bolt IoT with Alexa to control the output device through voice and to measure and monitor power consumption by the device remotely from anywhere using IoT and generating SMS representing the consumed power by the device
Things used in this project
Hardware components:
•	Bolt IoT WiFi module
•	330 Ω resistor-1
•	yellow LED-1
•	some jumper wires
•	breadboard-1
•	Type B USB Cable
•	DC 0-25V voltage sensor module-1- https://www.electronicscomp.com/voltage-detection-sensor-module-india?srsltid=AR57-fD3Y23qZxO_mJ9yHb9UVzezWlolzZaMzesmw8lPfeNbShyHaZ1Qtlw

Software Components:
•	Bolt Cloud
•	Bolt IoT android app
•	Amazon Alexa app
•	Twilio SMS API
•	Python IDE


Hence IoT can be brought in to several ways according to the application we are working on, in this project, we can control the device just by voice command (ofcourse Alexa helped us to achieve this) and measure, visualize, and monitor the voltage across and power consumed by the device and sending of SMS by Twilio
